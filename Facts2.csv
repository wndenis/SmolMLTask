https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;McCLELLAN :Well , the meeting was just -- or the visit was just announced yesterday .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;McCLELLAN :Well , we put forward a number of proposals when it comes to helping workers and helping them meet their needs in the future .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;And so we 're in discussions with the Europeans , with Russia , with China , with others , about how to move forward .And there will be a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in early February to look at referring the matter to the Security Council .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Well , I think if that was said , it ignores the reality , because the President has been leading the way when it comes to making sure that we 're enforcing our borders and that we 're also continuing to be a welcoming society for people that want to come here for the right reasons .And that 's why the President has outlined a comprehensive approach to immigration reform , an approach that is based on continuing to take steps to strengthen our borders , as well as moving forward on a temporary worker program to meet an important economic need .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;QCan I one -- just one follow - up , Scott , because I think just to refresh your memory , when the whole Enron scandal came up , and there were questions about Ken Lay 's ties to President Bush , this White House -- and you may have even worked on this -- under your predecessor provided specific information on White House meetings between Ken Lay and senior staff .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Then the President had his usual briefings .He had the meeting with President Basescu , and the two leaders spoke at the end of that meeting , and took some questions .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"Oh , it 's going to be long --that 's my understanding , just kind of an initial check , just -- there are probably a few staff - level meetings and that 's about it -- 
 Q";meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Oh , I disagree .I think it 's something that he discusses when he meets with leaders around the world .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"Q Okay , you talked about the Hanukkah receptions .Can you talk about the staff - level meetings and what years those were , or -- 
 MR .";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"QSo you were at the meeting , did you see any comments from any of the former Secretaries that the President did n't seem to like ? 
 MR .";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;No .Again , we do n't get into discussing staff - level meetings .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Well , I think if that was said , it ignores the reality , because the President has been leading the way when it comes to making sure that we 're enforcing our borders and that we 're also continuing to be a welcoming society for people that want to come here for the right reasons .And that 's why the President has outlined a comprehensive approach to immigration reform , an approach that is based on continuing to take steps to strengthen our borders , as well as moving forward on a temporary worker program to meet an important economic need .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;We are firmly committed to continuing to help the Iraqi people build a lasting democracy and help them with reconstruction .The international community has important responsibilities to meet , as well .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"But the deficit - reduction plan that the President has outlined is based really on two things : one , continuing to keep our economy growing stronger ; and two , exercising spending restraint .And Congress has met the top - line budget numbers that we have outlined over the previous couple years , and we 're confident they 'll do it again this year so that we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years . 
";meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;QOf course you do , whenever you want to discuss staff - level meetings .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;That 's the goal that we 're working to accomplish .And we remain firmly committed to helping the interim government meet that timetable .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;McCLELLAN : We 've always been supportive of what I spelled out , and that 's -- that the Taiwan Relations Act -- that 's any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful means .We believe that there ought to be cross - strait dialogue .;cross;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;FLEISCHER :I 'm not sure if it was discussed at a ministerial level or some other level , but to the best of my knowledge -- and I sat in on most of the meetings the President had --;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"That is the first step of the Mitchell Accords .There have been meetings between the Israelis and the Palestinians to discuss security arrangements in the Middle East . 
";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;McCLELLAN : It does n't change what I just said .Again , look at the meeting that took place earlier today , and let me again describe for you the nature of that meeting .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"And I do n't think getting into discussion about this -- discussing this , is fair to anybody beyond responding to what your question was . 
As a general matter , there were just a few staff level meetings and a couple of holiday receptions , is what I 've been able to learn .";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;He 's been -- he was here yesterday afternoon and participated in a lengthy meeting last night with our combatant commanders who are in town .This is an annual meeting that takes place , and he 's been attending meetings throughout the morning , including the intelligence briefing that he attends on a daily basis with the President .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;McCLELLAN : I did check .There were a few staff - level meetings .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"You have now talked , and the Transportation Secretary talked about coming up with your own plan .Does that suggest that what the air industry has put before Congress does not meet with entire administration approval , and you want to go in a different direction ? 
";meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"Really , the President is not the purveyor of that .The President is here really to greet them and to comfort them . 
";greet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"We must make sure that there 's no interruption or disruption of the resources that they need to be able to carry out their efforts that are aimed at protecting America and making us more secure . 
We also must meet an important economic need here at home , and that is reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy .";meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;I know that that 's been discussed in the past .And they 've also been working to make sure the recruiting goals are being met , as well .;meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"What got him in the door here ?How did he qualify for meetings here ? 
";meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"The President has said previously that he hopes that this matter can be resolved peacefully , and that the best way for this to be resolved peacefully is through the actions of Saddam Hussein .We will see what happens in the meeting tomorrow , what the message is , and I 'll have a report for you tomorrow . 
";meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;FLEISCHER :The congressional leaders meeting focused much more broadly than the National Security Council meeting .;meet|meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"Q Scott , a two - part .With regard to reports of the President meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld , considering the just concluded fast of an Episcopal Navy chaplain , why has n't the President , as Commander - in - Chief , ordered the United States Navy to stop any action whatsoever against Christian chaplains who mention Christ , Jewish chaplains who mention God , and Muslim chaplains who mention Mohammed ? 
 MR .";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;They are treated well , they are treated humanely .The International Committee for the Red Cross has access to go down there and look .;cross;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"That is the first step of the Mitchell Accords .There have been meetings between the Israelis and the Palestinians to discuss security arrangements in the Middle East . 
";meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;What I was asked is to go and check on this , and I did .And there were only a couple of holiday receptions that he attended , and then a few staff - level meetings on top of that .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"We had been supporting their efforts .And so what we 'll continue to do is discuss the next steps with the Europeans and Russia and China and others as we move closer to the board meeting and at the board meeting . 
";meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;QIn limiting this battle against terrorism to groups which threaten the United States , what incentive is there for the international coalition the President is trying to assemble to join in ?;assemble;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"In terms of the softwood 
 lumber issue 
 , this is something that we 've had a disagreement over .The President has discussed it on a number of occasions when he 's met with the Prime Minister there .";meet;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"And the President calls upon all Angolans to fulfill their obligations to peace there . 
As you mentioned , President dos Santos will be here tomorrow , along with President Chissano of Mozambique and Mogae of Botswana , for a meeting with the President .";meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Well , like I said , and like the President has indicated , we 're not going to prejudge what may take place at the Security Council .The first step is to go forward with this board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;I 'm not aware of any conversations the President has had about that .But , of course , the United States is following closely the developments involving the meeting between India and Pakistan .;meeting;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;But all of this can be addressed .All of this can be done , if the Senate is willing to take action this week as a result of the meetings the President had with the Senate Democrats and the conversations he 's had on the phone with them .;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"QWhat are their views , if you have met with them ? 
";meet;No;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;QI had a question about the CBS broadcast tonight , but first of all , could you address the second half of the question about the Voloshin meeting ?;meeting;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;I welcome the opportunity to do this -- but they know the difference between honest critics who question the way the war is being prosecuted -- we welcome that .In fact , the President has met with some of those honest critics .;meet;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;"Can you tell us what 's going to top the agenda thereand why did the President want to meet with Prime Minister Blair in Crawford as opposed to here at the White House ? 
";meet;Yes;;
https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov;meet;Well , like I said , and like the President has indicated , we 're not going to prejudge what may take place at the Security Council .The first step is to go forward with this board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency .;meeting;No;;
